                                    As a User Experience Designer at Cerved Group I worked on the design and development of digital products for corporate clients in the financial and banking industries.

                                    <p>I started my work at Cerved as a designer focusing on the improvement of the main products of Cerved Group, in
                                        particular the <a href="https://marketintelligence.cerved.com/">Marketing Intelligence</a> platform and <a href="https://www.cerved.com/risk-intelligence/rischio-di-credito/business-information/cerved-credit-suite/">Cerved Credit Suite</a>.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Both products provide data and information about companies, markets, credit risk and
                                        financial analysis.
                                        <br>
                                        They are used by thousands of customers in Europe such as Accenture, PWC, Trenitalia and Poste italiane.
                                    
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        My contribution to these platforms was gathering customer feedbacks about the <underline>data visualization</underline> in order to define new and more
                                        accurate charts and indicators to represent the data.

                                        <i>- Too many designers</i>

                                    <!--Description-->
                                    <p>Since the design team had been using <code>Sketch</code> as their main design tool and there were many issues with it, I proposed to move our projects and
                                        operations to <code>Figma</code> in order to improve the efficiency and features available to all designers.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        In order to achieve that I researched and planned a transition with the different project teams. I supported their
                                        organization and the rework needed in terms of files, resources, components and libraries to be moved onto the new tool.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        After the initial phase of transition I supported the entire design team through publishing learning resources on
                                        best practices on how to utilize Figma, in the form of video pills, courses and template resources.
                                        <br>

                                        <!--//TODO - Picture of one of my video pills-->

                                        </figure>

                                        The entire process took about two months and the increase of speed and efficiency with which the design team could
                                        produce new assets was tangible, making the transition worthwhile.

                                    <p>My main activity as a UX designer has been through the design and development of several digital products for corporate clients such as <a href="https://bnl.it/it/">BNL</a>, <a href="https://www.bancodesio.it/it">Banco Desio</a> .
                                        <br>
                                        For each project I was part of a <code>Scrum</code> team composed by developers, data scientists, Product owner and Scrum master. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>

                                        My role was evenly distributed throughout all the different phases of the projects.
                                        Starting from the business evaluation of the client requests, I would assist the product owner and business analysts in defining the requisites of the proposed solution.
                                        <br>
                                        In this phase I would perform customer and <code>user interviews</code> to gather insights and explore alternative solutions to propose to the board of stakeholders, leading workshops and meetings.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        
                                        In the second phase I was tasked with designing <code>user journeys</code>, personas and <code>service blueprints</code>, in order to define a preliminary version of the product offered to the client.
                                        <br>
                                        In this phase I would also combine different requirements from developers and data scientists, regarding technologies implemented and variations to the client requirements.
                                        <br>
                                        After this I would create mock-ups and <code>prototypes</code> with Figma that represented the actual front-end flows the user would interact with.
                                        Also at this stage I would assist the Product Owner in defining <code>user stories</code> and managing the product backlog in Jira.
                                        I would also follow the development process through each sprint and gather user feedbacks with <code>usability tests</code> and analysing user interactions.
                                    
                                    </p>

                                    <p>One of the biggest projects I was involved in was the development of the internal design system, following the
                                        transition to Figma tokens.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I was part of the design team tasked with the organization, design and maintenance of the <code>Design System</code>
                                        utilized by all the Product teams in Cerved to develop new products.
                                        <br>
                                        This project has been a direct collaboration with the development team, and involved more than twenty people.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The first step was clustering all the foundational elements of the company, such as: color styles, typography, UI
                                        elements, front-end frameworks and technologies utilised by all the different teams.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Subsequentially, we defined a common ground of practices and values that were shared between the various product teams.
                                        From there we planned a roadmap for the design and development of the various assets and foundations of the new design system.
                                        <br>

                                        We decided to structure the organization of the work with two teams, one composed by designers and one by developers. This in order to separate the activities of design and development and speed up the internal processes.
                                        <br>

                                        Each team would have a separate Backlog of activities, enabling designers to produce the assets that would drive the development of the actual components of the design system.
                                        <br>

                                            <!-- <figcaption>Description</figcaption> -->
                                        </figure>
                                        
                                        Communication was kept daily between the teams, with a minimum of one review per week of the work done and the planning of following activities.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Every two weeks we held a more structured review with all different product teams of the company (roughly 100 people) where we would preview the progress of the project, release assets completed and gather feedbacks. 

                                        <br>
                                        <br>

                                        As a starting point for the structure of the code we utilised the <a href="https://mui.com/material-ui/all-components/">Material UI</a> component library. This helped as a starting ground for the development team on which we implemented custom elements for patterns and components.

                                        <br>
                                        <br>

                                        <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a> was the choice for the code repository and enabled us to structure issues for code reviews and feedbacks directly from the product teams.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Once the assets, components and pattern were developed we set up <a href="https://storybook.js.org/">Storybook</a> as a tool for documentation and single source of truth.
                                        
                                        <br>
                                        This helped simplify the communication with design and develepment teams of the various products and projects inside the company. 
                                        <br>
                                        In addition to that, we set up a serie of courses and events, where each single project team was instructed by the Design system team on how to utilize the components, patterns and foundatoins.

                                    <br>

                                        Since the beginning of the 2020 pandemic, it became clear that digital transformation and business process
                                        optimization was extremely important, in order to adapt to the new situation.
                                        <br>
                                        For this reason, I collaborated with <a href="https://trentinosviluppo.it/">Trentino Sviluppo</a> in redesigning the internal
                                        processes of the companies located in their innovation centre, supporting them in a digital transition.
                                        <br>
                                        After a first phase of discovery and discussion with the companies, it became clear that the main pain point was the need of a digital tool that would track and orchestrate the production line of the companies.

                                        From there I was asked to move forward the project and actively lead a professional <code>scrum</code> team, set up by <a href="https://trilogy.it/">Trilogy srl</a>, in the actual realisation of the digital product for <a href="https://www.metalworkingweb.com/en/">Metalworking srl</a>.

                                        We started the project by examining and researching the company's processes and user pain points.
                                        This was done by visits to the production site, interviews with employees and mapping key flows and documentation of the business.

                                        <br>
                                        As a first action we inspected the actual production line with the help of the business owners to get a deeper understanding and a first hand look at the company.
                                        <br>
                                        Through these visits we gathered material to help us define a streamlined model of the internal processes.
                                        <br>
                                        This would also prove important in order to have a direct contact with the potential users of our application.

                                        We started outlining the various parts in a flow diagram and identified a total of 12 production steps.
                                        <br>
                                        This helped track the necessary data in every step, the actions required by the operators and potential improvements and optimization of the overall flow.

                                        Following this action we planned a set of interviews, involving most of the employees of the company. This in order to get the main pain points they were facing with the former process and, potentially, point out potential opportunities of improvement.
                                        <br>
                                        At the end of this two weeks period of interviews, we analysed the transcripts and documentation gathered and isolated the main <code>personas</code> that would be the target for the product.

                                        The crucial pain points that emerged were focused around:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>lack of communication between line steps</li>
                                            <li>improve consistency of documentation</li>
                                            <li>provide support for quality assurance</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        
                                        <br>
                                        After a serie of reviews with the stakeholders, where we outlined the proposed solution and findings, we got green light to procede with the planning of development activities.

                                        As for the planning phase, I set out with the <code>scrum</code> team to define the product backlog in terms of user stories and epics necessaries.
                                        <br>
                                        In this stage we also involved two main stakeholder of the company, in order to get direct feedbacks of the specifications and assure a shared understanding of the future developments.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> was the tool of choice for keeping track of requirements.
                                        <br>
                                        Each user story would follow a base template to keep consistency and simplify the review and acceptance process.
                                        <br>
                                        I would also write acceptance criteria, shared with the company stakeholders, to guide the internal reviews during which we would show the progress and completed tasks.
                                        <br>
                                        Each story would then be weighted by the developers and organised in the product backlog according to its priority in terms of value for the company.

                                        <figure>

                                            <figcaption>A user story template we used</figcaption>
                                        </figure>

                                        Based on the characteristics of each user story we also outlined several groups of functionalities that our product would have covered:
                                        <br>
                                        
                                        <strong>Users authentication</strong>, <strong>Production line steps</strong>, <strong>Users management</strong>, <strong>Manufactures database</strong>, <strong>Filters and dashboards</strong>
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        
                                        These would form our set of epics with which organise our product backlog and development phase.

                                        The final product was a backlog of around 100 user stories, organised by priority, weighted and approved with the company stakeholders.

                                        The development phase was structured in sprints with the duration of two weeks.
                                        <br>
                                        Following <code>scrum</code> framework, we would convene on a sprint goal for each sprint and define user stories to be completed.
                                        We held daily updates internal to the development team to track potential issues or blockers, while I as the product owner, had meetings with the stakeholders twice per week
                                        <br>
                                        This organization helped us keep a lean communication between all the parties involved.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        At the end of the sprint, we held one internal review with the development team in a test environment, to check everything together and prepare a review with the company.
                                        <br>
                                        The official sprint review would be held the last day of the sprint, where we presented the stakeholders with the progress and user stories completed.
                                        <br>
                                        As a measure of completeness we would follow the Acceptance Criteria in each story, this helped us align the expectations of all the parties involved.
                                        <br>
                                        Once the sprint was completed each user story that passed the review would be pushed to the production environment, where the company could start interact with the final product.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        As conclusion of the sprint we held a retrospective guided by the <code>scrum master</code> to outline potential improvements or blockers inside the team.
                                        <br>
                                        We would also plan a first draft of the following sprint to be shared with the stakeholders of the company.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The overall progress of the development phase was tracked through metrics using mainly <code>burndown charts</code>. This was a tool for our team to always refer to, both to evaluate our efforts and maintain our commitment to the customer.

                                        While working as the <code>Product owner</code> I would also follow the design of user interfaces, helping the UI designer of the team.
                                        <br>
                                        Together we would take user requirements and elaborate <code>Figma</code> prototypes to be shared with the users.
                                        <br>
                                        For each story requiring a user interface, we would set up a serie of tests with the users in order to gather direct feedbacks.
                                        <br>
                                        These interfaces would then be attached to the user story and drive the development team in the realization of the Front-end. In terms of Palette and Fonts we followed the guidelines of the company's brand.

                                        The entire development phase took around 10 months. Once the majority of the features were released we started implementing a feedback system for additional improvements and evaluating usability. 
                                        <br>
                                        As for tracking requests, bugs and improvements we used various tools such as <a href="https://ybug.io/">ybug</a>, <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/">hotjar</a> and user tests.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        For this task, we involved specific users in different sectors of the company. With them we planned a serie of usability tests of their activities and tracked how much time would take them to complete.
                                        <br>
                                        In the subsequent releases we tried to optimize those metrics and increase the overall productivity of the users in their operations.

                                        The project was completed on schedule in 12 months, delivering a new information system that helped the company document and track the activities in the production line.
                                        <br>
                                        From there the company asked us to extend the project in order to integrate other parts of their information system in our solution, such as customers orders and external purchases.

                                    During my period of study abroad I've launched a startup as one of 3 amazing co-founders, developing a modern web
                                    platform for influencer marketing.
                                    Our goal was modernizing the relationship between social media creators and brands.

                                    My role in the team was analysing the market feasibility of the project, define innovative strategies and ultimately
                                    design the user experience of our services and product.

                                        One of my colleagues had been working in the marketing and advertising industry for several years, particularly in close contact with content creators.
                                        <br>
                                        Noting the difficulties of communication between brands and influencers he decided to come up with a more effective solution, one that could leverage digital tools and ease the steps required for brands to market their products through influencer marketing.
                                        With his expertise we started analysing the actual market need and possible solutions of this challenge.

                                        As a first step we decided to analyse market trends and the actual space in the segment.
                                        Although market data are not always easy to come by, nor provide an ultimate source of truth it was interesting to note how the market expanded and was expected to grow in the next years.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        After this initial step, we set out to look for the competition in the market and find new insights.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        We realised that the major investments in the influencer marketing industry were mainly between big corporate brands and extremely popular content creators or influencers, which have millions of followers on their social media pages.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        This kind of collaborations comprised the production of sponsored contents or advertising from the influencer, in exchange of a high monetary compensation from the brands
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Two main problems emerged from this analysis:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Brands would have to pay top dollars in order to reach top influencers</li>
                                            <li>Top influencers tend to underperform in terms of engagement with their followers</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        
                                        Addressing these two challenges seemed an interesting opportunity to develop our business idea.
                                        In particular we decided to evaluate whether this advertising model could be applied also to a smaller scale, both from the brand and influencer's side.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The next step was to gain primary insights on these challenges through interviews of possible customers and users, and evaluate a possible business model.

                                        The main activity we performed during this stage was contacting as many as possible small-medium influencers (from 1k to 100k followers) on the principal social media platforms.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Thanks to our co-founder that had previous connections in the industry, we managed to create a consistent group of content creators that were interested in the project and were eager to answer our questions about their work.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        After gaining insights from <code>interviews</code>, observations of their daily work and <code>group meetings</code> we developed our hypothesis on the needs, pain points and possible solutions that our tool should provide in order to be successful.

                                        The second step we took was analysing the brand side. For this part we focused on small, medium and large brands that were already present on the main social media platforms and were actively sponsoring their products.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Also regarding this side we directly contacted the brands asking for interviews and questions about their marketing strategies, pain points and needs.

                                        Concluded this phase we realized that there was an actual need from possible customers and users, so we set out to define a business model that could be sustainable.

                                        During the initial 2 weeks of our first acceleration program we were able to define our first business model and elaborate a differentiation strategy from the competitors already in the market.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        In particular we decided to focus our efforts on providing a simpler and much more efficient way for small and medium enterprises to collaborate and create marketing campaigns with emerging influencers.
                                        <br>
                                        As we developed our business model we had the opportunity to analyse the competitors already in the market, in particular in the <strong>Finnish</strong> and <strong>Baltic region</strong>.
                                        The main competitor was a startup based in Helsinki, <a href="https://boksi.com/">Boksi</a>, that had raised a couple of millions in funding and that operated with a similar business model, but focused on much bigger customers.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Another competitor was <a href="https://promoty.io/">Promoty</a>, a platform for marketing campaigns that focused on providing consulting services to corporate companies.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        As a result we decided to focus on the top right sector of the competition matrix, delivering services to a specific niche (small sme's and emerging influencers) and making our product very easy to use and start making marketing campaigns.

                                        After this first validation we started developing our product and defined all the features and characteristics emerged while talking with the potential users.

                                        In this phase I prototyped different <code>mockup</code> versions of the platform, both mobile and web. Consequentely I evaluated them with the influencers and brands, in order to get <code>feedbacks</code> on the main features and the overall journey through the service.
                                        Thanks to the expertise of our technical co-founder Kelvin we were able to develop a first version of the platform and have a minimum viable version online in a couple of weeks.

                                        With our platform up and running we started actively engaging customers and users that we had been in contact previously.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Here we ran our test campaigns with a couple of brands and fine-tuned the process through our service. We made small adjustments around features and simplified the signup process.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The first campaigns were a huge success both in terms of engagement, metrics evaluated and customer satisfaction. 
                                        <br>
                                        With only a few influencers creating content our first customers were able to reach more than ten thousand people and increase traffic to their social media pages and physical stores. All of this only by offering sample products to the influencers, that they reviewed and posted about on their social media accounts. Also the engagement of each post was extremely successful, with hundreds of comments each. 
                                        <br>
                                        From these first campaigns we learned how sample products could replace in part monetary rewards for emerging influencers and thus make sustainable for small brands to collaborate with them.

                                        Consequent to our launch we were accepted in several accelerator programs, including the <strong>NorthboundStartups</strong> hold in Tallin and the <strong>StartupJourney</strong> held by <a href="https://www.boostturku.org/">Boost</a> in the Turku region.

                                        Here we had the opportunity to meet mentors that helped us scale our operations. In a few months we reached hundreds of active influencers on our platform and ran several campaigns with brands in the baltic region.

                                        We were then able to pitch in front of a pool of investors and compete for a 200k investment with other startups.

                                        The Open Italy program started out with 8 weeks of intense training through classes, workshops with corporate experts and live meetings about co-innovation.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        During these period I had the opportunity to understand from a busines perspective the actual work of a <code>Innovation manager</code>.
                                        <br>
                                        The workshops with experts from <a href="https://www.bip-group.com/">BIP</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> and other big corporates helped us gain real life experience on the structure of innovation projects and management.

                                        At the end of this period we were ready to move onto the collaboration phase with corporate clients and startups.

                                        For the second phase of the project we were tasked by several corporates to generate and validate innovative solutions for their business problems.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I was part of a team of 5 brilliant young professionals from different fields, from development, engineering to design and sociology.
                                        <br>
                                        Together we worked on the business requests by corporates like <a href="">A2A</a>, <a href="">ENI</a> and <a href="">TIM</a>.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Each project revolved around:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>gathering business requisites and understanding the problem statement</li>
                                            <li>formulate innovative solutions through <code>design thinking</code> practices</li>
                                            <li>explore and validate the most promising ideas</li>
                                            <li>generate mockups and flows and present to the stakeholders</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        At the end of this phase we helped the corporates match with several startups that provided similar solutions to our propositions.
